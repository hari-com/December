- I came from the SW testing background and this is a new world for me. 
So, please be patience with me and I will go as I learn and eventually will own some process and contrubute team.

- What are the tools I will be working and what will be my Day to Day work?


Need insight on:
- Need help setting utilizing AMD internal lib and tools and how to know what to use when? 
   like AGT, AGI and others...I tried but could not properly...

- Our repo strutcruture, which repo is for what purpose? How do I know where to put my scripts?
   There is no Dev, QA or Staging branch....? or Master or feature branch?

- Need to clearly underestand our team role in whole product cycle...
Which stage are we involved in? 
Which test scope falls under our R&R?
Is there dedicated QA team? where they located?

- I am familier with HW side as well, any lab/HW related work for me in the future? 
Will need few trainings on the Lab side if I need to work in the Lab in the future(BIOS flashing/updating...)

- Code review process? How are we maintaing this, I do not see the PR process... If I write any new script, where should I push?

- Need some JIRA traning as well, may be later when MI200 test will take place...


R&R perpective:
- I am not a Python/coding guy but can learn more as I go and help writing simple scripts,
From Python perpective, what is your expectation from me regarding python?

- I have Jenkins experience, but was wondering if there be enough Jenkins work for two people since Igor is already working on Jenkins?

- Are we responsible for writing new test cases in python? What kinds of test cases... Do we have previous test cases?
