- I came from the SW testing background and this is a new world for me. So, please be patience with me and I will go as I learn.
- What are the tools I will be working and what will be my Day to Day work?
- I am not a Python/coding guy but can learn more as I go and help writing simple scripts, from Python perpective, what is your expectation from me regarding python?
- I have Jenkins experience, but was wondering if there be enough Jenkins work for two people since Igor is already working on Jenkins?
- Are we responsible for writing new test cases in python? What kinds of test cases... Do we have previous test cases?


Need insight on:
- Our repo strutcruture, which repo is for what purpose? How do I know where to put my scripts?
- Need help setting utilizing AMD internal lib and tools and how to know what to use when? like AGT, AGI and others...I tried but could not properly...

- Need to underestand our team role in whole product cycle...Which stage are you? where is the dedicated QA team? Which test falls under our R&R and what is the test scope?

- Code review process? How are we maintaing this, I do not see the PR process... If I write any new script, where should I push?
- Need some JIRA traning as well, may be later when MI200 test will take place...
- 
- I am familier with HW side as well, any lab/HW related work for me in the future? will need quick trainings on BIOS flashing/updating...
