Step 1: Install Java Version 8
To install Java version 8 execute the below command:
yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
sudo yum install wget
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.0.M10/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.0.M10.tar.gz
tar xzf apache-tomat-9.0.0.M10.tar.gz
mv apache-tomcat-9.0.0.M10 tomcat9

Step 2: Settings the users on tomcat-users.xml
/home/hari/tomcat9/conf/tomcat-users.xml
Now delete the content of the tomcat-users.xml file. Copy the below block and paste it in tomcat-users.xml file. 

<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<tomcat-users>
    <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
    <role rolename="manager-script"/>
    <role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
    <role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
    <role rolename="admin-gui"/>
    <role rolename="admin-script"/>
    <user username="admin" password="admin123" roles="manager-gui,manager-script,manager-jmx,manager-status,admin-gui,admin-script"/>
</tomcat-users>
The updated tomcat-users.xml file will look like this:

In the above image, as you can see that I have defined several roles and for all these roles.
I have given one single username and password i.e. admin and admin123. If you want to assign different username and password for different roles you can do that as well.
Now save it and close the file to go back to the terminal.

We need to start Apache Tomcat now, but before that I will change my directory to Tomcat9 by executing the below command:
cd tomcat9
To start Tomcat use the below command:
./bin/startup.sh
So, Tomcat has now started.
localhost:8080 



Step 3: Download Jenkins war File
http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war
https://jenkins.io/download/


Step 4: Deploy Jenkins war File 
To deploy Jenkins war file that you have downloaded in the previous step, open your browser and access localhost:8080 again. Now click on the Manager App.
username: admin | PW: admin123 (as we setup on the tomcat user.xml file) 

Start Tomcat
./tomcat9/bin/startup.sh
 
Now in the Tomcat web application manager page you can find Jenkins listed under Applications along with other web apps.

Step 5: Install Suggested Plugins 
When I clicked on jenkins I was directed to Unlock Jenkins page. Please refer to the below snapshot:
In order to unlock Jenkins first copy the part that I have highlighted in the screenshot above.
This is the location that contains your one time password for Jenkins 

/home/hari/.jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
