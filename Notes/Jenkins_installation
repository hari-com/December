Install Jenkins
=================
In this blog, I will guide you through the installation process of Jenkins. Just follow the below steps to install Jenkins along with its suggested plugins. In case you are curious to know more about Jenkins, click here to find all the necessary details.
The complete process to install Jenkins can be summarized in five steps:
1.	Install Java Version 8 – Jenkins is a Java based application, hence Java is a must.
2.	Install Apache Tomcat Version 9 – Tomcat is required to deploy Jenkins war file.
3.	Download Jenkins war File – This war is required to install Jenkins.
4.	Deploy Jenkins war File – Jenkins war file needs to be deployed using Tomcat to run Jenkins.
5.	Install Suggested Plugins – Install a list of plugins suggested by Jenkins.


Step 1: Install Java Version 8
To install Java version 8 execute the below command:
yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk
sudo yum install wget
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.0.M10/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.0.M10.tar.gz
tar xzf apache-tomat-9.0.0.M10.tar.gz
mv apache-tomcat-9.0.0.M10 tomcat9



Step 2: Settings the users on tomcat-users.xml

/home/hari/tomcat9/conf/tomcat-users.xml

Now delete the content of the tomcat-users.xml file. Copy the below block and paste it in tomcat-users.xml file. 

<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<tomcat-users>
    <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
    <role rolename="manager-script"/>
    <role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
    <role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
    <role rolename="admin-gui"/>
    <role rolename="admin-script"/>
    <user username="admin" password="admin123" roles="manager-gui,manager-script,manager-jmx,manager-status,admin-gui,admin-script"/>
</tomcat-users>

The updated tomcat-users.xml file will look like this:
In the above image, as you can see that I have defined several roles and for all these roles.
I have given one single username and password i.e. admin and admin123. If you want to assign different username and password for different roles you can do that as well.
Now save it and close the file to go back to the terminal.

We need to start Apache Tomcat now, but before that I will change my directory to Tomcat9 by executing the below command:
cd tomcat9
To start Tomcat use the below command:
./bin/startup.sh
So, Tomcat has now started.
localhost:8080 



Step 3: Download Jenkins war File
http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war
https://jenkins.io/download/


Step 4: Deploy Jenkins war File 
To deploy Jenkins war file that you have downloaded in the previous step, open your browser and access localhost:8080 again. Now click on the Manager App.
username: admin | PW: admin123 (as we setup on the tomcat user.xml file) 


Now you will be directed to  Tomcat web application manager page. When you scroll down you will find an option called Deploy. 
Over here you need to give the context path, i.e. /jenkins and directory URL, i.e. location of the Jenkins war file in your system.

/home/hari/jenkins.war and finally click on Deploy.


./tomcat9/bin/startup.sh

 
Now in the Tomcat web application manager page you can find Jenkins listed under Applications along with other web apps.

Step 5: Install Suggested Plugins 
When I clicked on jenkins I was directed to Unlock Jenkins page. Please refer to the below snapshot:
In order to unlock Jenkins first copy the part that I have highlighted in the screenshot above.
This is the location that contains your one time password for Jenkins 

/home/hari/.jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

Hence, just copy the path from the screen on your end and go back to the terminal.
Finally, use the following command to get your one time password:
cat <paste the location that you have copied>
Once you have pasted the password, click on continue.
Now I will install plugins. As you see in the below snapshot there are two options i.e. either I can go with suggested plugins or I can select plugins on my own.
 
I will go with Install Suggested Plugins.
Snapshot below will give you a list of plugins that will be installed when you click on Install Suggested Plugins.
 
Once the plugins are installed, you will be directed to a page where you have to Create First Admin User. 
Please fill your relevant details.
 
After filling this form, click on save and finish. 
Jenkins is ready now,
